This is a very simple "seed" conceptual model:.
Business is run using business functions (not shown).
Business functions define *Roles*. For example, *Java Developer*. 
Roles require *Skills*. 
Skills are provided by parties which can be humans, AI agents, organizations.
On the diagram such parties are represented by the **Candidate** node.

Candidates have skills obtained through training and work experience.
Possession of skills can be verified by credentials such as
diplomas and certifications.
It can also be verified by interviewing candidates and analyzing candidates' CV models for inconsistencies.
