Users interact with the system via the User Interface. 
There might be multiple user interaces used by different users and even by the same user.

## CLI (Command line)

(CLI)[https://docs.nasdanika.org/nsd-cli/index.html] solutions are flexible and low-cost
comparing to some other options. 
They can be used on destkops/laptops, in build pipelines, cloud servers and serversless functions.

CLI solutions can "host" the model and business logic and Web UI/API. 
They can also be used in conjunction with Draw.io.

## Draw.io

[Draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/) is a general-purpose versatile diagramming tool. 
It can be used to visually create models using [semantic mapping](https://docs.nasdanika.org/core/mapping/index.html) as 
explained in the [Semantic Mapping](https://medium.com/nasdanika/semantic-mapping-3ccbef5d6c70) 
and [Visual Communication Continuum](https://medium.com/nasdanika/visual-communication-continuum-4946f44ba853#fe49) stories.

## Web UI

Web UI can be built in a variety of ways including a polymorphic UI generated from the model metadata.
Web UI requires more effort than CLI/Draw.io. 
It can includ Draw.io diagrams and other visualizations. 

## Mobile application

Mobile applications would require even more effort.

## API

APIs can be used by automated systems such as AI agents.
One flavor of an API is a static set of cross-referencing JSON files generated by a build job on model commit/push.

## Eclipse Sirius

[Eclipse Sirius](https://eclipse.dev/sirius/) can be used as the next step after Draw.io.
Eclipse Sirius-based solutions would be specialized, and as such more powerful than Draw.io.
At the same time, they would require knowledge of Eclipse and more effort to build.

## Eclipse Sirius Web

[Sirius Web](https://eclipse.dev/sirius/sirius-web.html) can be used in a Web browser and would requie a server to run it.
