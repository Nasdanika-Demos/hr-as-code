Business logic can be implemented in Java and JVM/scripting languages such as Groovy.
Part of the logic may reside in the metamodel and the modes - instance level polymorphism.

AI agents may also be used to implement business logic. 
They can use the model logic.

Business logic can be added to solutions delaratively using the [Capability Framework](https://docs.nasdanika.org/core/capability/index.html), including [Invocable URIs](https://docs.nasdanika.org/core/capability/index.html#loading-invocables-from-uris).

Business logic can be packaged as a CLI assembly, web service, serverless function (e.g., Lambda), or GitHub Action.
CLI assemblies are especially versatile—they can be used in GitHub Actions and serverless functions alike: assemble once, run anywhere.
